# Project Overview
Welcome to Movie Match, your personalized movie recommendation system! Powered by the Close Match algorithm, Movie Match offers highly accurate movie suggestions based on your preferences.

# Dataset
For this project, I utilized the dataset from the YBI Foundation Kaggle repository. You can access the dataset here. This dataset contains comprehensive information about movies, user ratings, and other relevant features necessary for building our recommendation system.

How It Works

Close Match Algorithm: Movie Match uses the Close Match algorithm to identify approximate string matches, accommodating minor input variations such as typos or incomplete titles.
