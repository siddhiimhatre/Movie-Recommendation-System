Customer Purchase Prediction & Micro-Numerosity Analysis
Author: Viraj N. Bhutada
Project Overview
Welcome to the Customer Purchase Prediction & Micro-Numerosity Analysis project! In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of predicting customer purchase behavior and delve into the insights offered by Micro-Numerosity Analysis.

Dataset
For this project, the dataset is sourced from the YBI Foundation Kaggle repository. You can access the dataset here. This dataset comprises detailed information about customers, including demographic details and reviews, essential for constructing our predictive model.

How It Works
Micro-Numerosity Analysis
The project utilizes Micro-Numerosity Analysis to understand the impact of small-scale numerical features on customer purchase predictions.
Predictive Modeling
A Random Forest Classifier is employed to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and review-related features.
Steps
Data Import and Exploration
Imported necessary libraries and loaded customer data.
Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Data Preprocessing
Defined target variable (y) and feature variables (X).
Encoded categorical variables for modeling.
Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Selection and Training
Chose a Random Forest Classifier for purchase prediction.
Trained the model using the training set.
Model Evaluation
Used the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
Evaluated the model accuracy using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
Feature Importance Visualization
Visualized the importance of each feature using a bar chart.
Identified key factors influencing purchase predictions.
Confusion Matrix Heatmap
Plotted a heatmap to illustrate model performance via a confusion matrix.
Analyzed true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
ROC Curve and AUC
Calculated and visualized the ROC curve and AUC to assess model discrimination.
Evaluated the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
Distribution of Predicted Probabilities
Examined the distribution of predicted probabilities for positive class predictions ('Yes').
Explored the model's confidence levels in predicting customer purchases.
Key Takeaways
Achieved an accuracy of 60% on the test set.
Feature importance analysis provided insights into influential factors.
Confusion matrix heatmap detailed model performance across different prediction categories.
ROC curve and AUC quantified the model's discriminative power.
Distribution of predicted probabilities shed light on model confidence.
Next Steps
Consider model refinement through hyperparameter tuning.
Explore additional features or engineering for enhanced predictive power.
Iterate on the analysis to improve overall model performance.
